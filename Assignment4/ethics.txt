A. 
	One idealization that was made in this assignment was that there is no external environment, mainly wind. If this was the case,
there would then be sand pixels being swept away. The main component that we represented computationally was the Brownian motion, this 
allowed for a more true and fluid behavior of the sand as it setteled. Another assumption we made is that all the sand and rocks were the 
same size which made the compuations muxh easier. However, we should recognize that this is not the case and they can obviously be different
sizes.

B.
	One thing computer sceintists should consider when making these simulations is to remember that the program is a simulation and 
therefore  should not expect an exact representation of the real-word situation. To communicate these assumptions, the programmer should 
provide a disclaimer which highlights the limitations of the program. This allows for some transparency for the user and then enables the user
to use their best judgement when analyzing the results of the simulation.
