	My response would be to give me a chance to try and input the algorithm with Unicode. Since ASCII is very limited and 
Unicode is much more expansive, there are alot of benefits to using it; Especially if it would be handling sensitive information.
If we were to build a system using purely ASCII code, the representational harm is that the informaton
being inputted could be passed as Unicode and if it is not properly filtered or converted, there could 
be some major issues in how the system runs in terms of interpreting the data.
