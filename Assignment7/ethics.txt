1. 
	I believe that advertisers paying search companies to boost their merchandise is a major 
ethical issue because the search results that users would be recieving would be completely biased.
The in which this could be handeled at a higher level is to simply ignore advertisers and not focus 
on monetary gain. However, this is never the case and even  Brin and Page went against their own words
and now are surely pushing a monetary agenda in terms of the serach results they are producing.

2.
	Like most of the other programs that we have created, bajillion is a powerful tool and as we
pass more data into it, we can see how many issues with bias could arise. One way the program could be 
extended is to provide a ranking function (similar to Google) today, where you present the articles in 
a ranked fashion. Or, you could also include some kind of frequency function where you also return to the 
user the number of times that the query was used in the article. At the end of the day, I believe the most
important goal of a search engine is to be transparent and provide authentic results.
